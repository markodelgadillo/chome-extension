# chome-extension

Building my first chrome extension

Using the tutorial from the here: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-create-and-publish-a-chrome-extension-in-20-minutes-6dc8395d7153

Initially will build the extension word for word then follow up with changes to morph it into a different type of extension that remains to be determined.
